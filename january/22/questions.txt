Question-1

Write a C++ program that reads the integer n and prints a twin prime that has the maximum size among twin primes less than or equal to n.
According to wikipedia "A twin prime is a prime number that is either 2 less or 2 more than another prime number" for example, either member of the twin prime pair (41, 43). In other words, a twin prime is a prime that has a prime gap of two".
